üöÄ Vehicle Insurance MLOps Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline for managing and deploying a machine learning model on vehicle insurance data. It covers end-to-end ML lifecycle management, including data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, deployment, and CI/CD automation using AWS, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

üîß Tech Stack
Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow)

Data Handling: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL Database)

Model Training & Deployment: Scikit-learn, AWS S3, AWS EC2

CI/CD & Automation: GitHub Actions, Docker, AWS ECR, EC2

Infrastructure: Virtual Environment (Conda), Environment Variables

Logging & Exception Handling: Python logging module

Web UI & API Integration: FastAPI/Flask (for the prediction pipeline)

üìÅ Project Structure
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup
Created a well-defined project template using template.py

Managed package dependencies in setup.py and pyproject.toml

Set up a virtual environment and installed dependencies from requirements.txt

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Pipeline & Storage
Configured MongoDB Atlas for data storage

Developed scripts to ingest, validate, and transform data before model training

Implemented data logging and exception handling for better debugging

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Evaluation
Preprocessed data using Feature Engineering & EDA techniques

Developed a machine learning model using Scikit-learn

Automated model evaluation and performance tracking

4Ô∏è‚É£ AWS Cloud Deployment & CI/CD
Configured AWS S3 for storing trained models

Set up AWS EC2 instance for deploying the model via a web API

Implemented GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation, integrating:

Docker: Containerized the application

AWS ECR: Hosted Docker images for deployment

GitHub Secrets: Managed AWS credentials securely

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment & API
Built a prediction pipeline with FastAPI/Flask

Hosted the model on AWS, accessible via an API endpoint

Set up a web UI for user interaction
